The Key and Plaintext file must be in the .txt format, with the key consisting of only lowercase latin letters, and the plaintext consisting of only lowercase latin letters and spaces. The Key must be at least as long as the Plaintext.  For more information on OTPs in general, visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad.
